# Spacebuilder2020-s-addon-mod-for-ender-io
This mod consists of random addons to enderio that may not be related to each other.

Currently it has IC2 EU conduits fully functioning, but may need to be improved to add loss.

In addition I am also planning on adding GT support for the conduits.  They will nativly convert between GT EU and IC2 EU, however, there may be some loss.
